              Some of us on the team have experienced suffering in our own lives. We feel fortunate
              to enjoy freedoms that many others do not possess, and this sense of gratitude compels
              us to give back. Realizing that the problems in our regions were too vast for us to
              address directly, we chose to focus on areas where the core conflicts had subsided but
              where children still needed help.

                Inspired by stories of transformation and awe-inspiring beauty in Nepal, we decided
                it would be the perfect place to begin our mission. It was there that we met Prakash
                Bista, a man whose story exemplifies the power of education and community.
