              We are a generation driven by the fear that we might not pass on to our children the
              world they deserve. The biggest challenge of this century will undoubtedly be climate
              change. While we may not yet know how to solve it, we believe education can empower
              more people to take part in tackling humanity&apos;s greatest challenges.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg font-urbanist">
              By sharing the education we&apos;ve been fortunate to receive in England with those
              who lack access, we hope to create a better shot at addressing these global problems.

              Tough times have certainly begun. But we do not yet consider ourselves strong. Only by
              overcoming challenges together, by fighting for what the child in each of us knows to
              be right,
              <strong> will we become truly resilient.</strong>
