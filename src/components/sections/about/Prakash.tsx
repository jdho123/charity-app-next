              Prakash Bista was born in Kalikot, a remote village where residents didn't even have
              access to a hospital. His parents, after a three-day walk to the nearest town, saw
              children in school uniforms and decided to send Prakash to a boarding school. He faced
              several hurdles throughout his education journey, with both his parents passing away
              just as he was preparing for his final end-of-school exams.

            <p className="text-xl font-urbanist">
              Despite these immense challenges, Prakash founded Impact Schools, convincing
              neighbours to trust him with building the first school in his village. With
              scholarships, he studied in the US and at LSE, but choosing not to stay abroad but to
              come back and give back to his community, Prakash returned home to expand Impact
              Schools. Today, these schools educate over 300 children and provide accommodations for
              more than 30 orphans.
