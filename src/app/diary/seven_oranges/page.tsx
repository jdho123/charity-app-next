        The Gift of Seven Oranges

      {/* Paragraph 1 */}
      <p className="text-xs text-[#7A3A12] pt-12 ml-24 mr-4">
        During one of our visits to Impact Schools, we met a little boy who had just become a part
        of the orphanage. He had suffered unbearable pain in the very long five years of his life.
        First, he lost his father, who was imprisoned, and then his mother, who tragically passed
        away from a heart attack while carrying a heavy load on the road back home. With no one else
        to look after him, his older sister became his sole caregiver.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xs text-[#7A3A12] pt-4 ml-36">
        During her visit to the orphanage, she brought him seven orangesâ€”a rare and precious gift
        for a child living in such challenging conditions. What happened next profoundly moved us.
      </p>

        The little boy walked up to one of us and, without hesitation, handed over all seven
        oranges. His gesture wasn&apos;t out of abundance but a pure expression of gratitude for our
        presence and support.
      </p>

      <p className="text-sm text-[#DB6B24] mb-6 ml-4 pr-20 mt-4">
        This single event influenced us more deeply than any book, speech, or memory. It showed us
        the boundless capacity for kindness that exists even in the face of profound loss and
        adversity.
